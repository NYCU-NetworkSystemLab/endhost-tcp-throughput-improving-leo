# End-host-based Methods for Improving TCP Throughput over Meter-policed LEO Networks.

**This work is based on <a href="https://github.com/snkas/hypatia">Hypatia</a>, an LEO module for ns-3 simulator.**

This work is evaluated through simulations with ns-3 and the Hypatia LEO module. We modified the ns-3 code to install a Token Bucket Meter in the LEO network and conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of TCP pacing, as well as our new proposal: ACK packet pacing.
